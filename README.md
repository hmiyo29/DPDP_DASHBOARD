# Dynamic Fleet Management of Waterborne Vessels for Mixed Services

There should be a README file explaining the content of the repository. You can mention an introduction about yourself, the theme of your research and a description of the project associated with your topic. Moreover, there should also be clear instructions on how to run the code.

Topics:
- introduction about yourself;
- theme of the research;
- project;
- instructions.

## Introduction
This repository is an assembly of source codes and materials of a model that have been developed as part of a master thesis project conducted by H.Miyoshi. This project aimed to develop a dynamic model that optimises the operations of waterborne vessels which serve passenger mobility and parcels in urban enrironment. As the circumstances of urban transportation has aggravated due to the rapid urbanisation, combining passenger mobility and parcels in urban transportation system has been proposed as an innovative solution to address these issues.
